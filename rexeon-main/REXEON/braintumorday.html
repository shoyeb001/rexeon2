            <p>
              8th June is observed as World Brain Tumour Day since 2000 to raise
              awareness and educate people about the disease. This day was first
              observed by the German Brain Tumour Association since it had been
              very common in Germany as more than 8,000 people were suffering
              from this disease only in Germany.<br />
              According to a report published in 2018, a brain tumour was ranked
              as the 10th most common kind of tumour among Indians. The
              International Association of Cancer Registries reported that there
              are over 28,000 cases of brain tumours reported in India each year
              and more than 24, 000 people die due to it annually. So, today
              let’s know about it precisely so that we can raise awareness among
              people about this disease and educate them to cure it in every
              possible way.<br />
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <b style="text-align: center">What exactly a tumour is?</b>
        <p>
          Mind you, a tumor is not necessarily a cancer but it can be cancerous.
          The word tumor simply refers to a mass. National Cancer Institution
          defines a tumor as an abnormal mass of tissue that forms when cells
          grow and divide more than they should or do not die when they should.
          There are two main types of tumors namely, malignant and benign
          tumors. The benign ones are not cancerous and cannot spread to other
          parts of the brain or body but the malignant tumors are cancerous;
          they grow uncontrollably and can spread to other parts of the body.
        </p>
        <br />
        <b style="text-align: center"
          >What are the symptoms of a Brain Tumour?</b
        >
        <p>
          Manifestations of a brain tumor may be nonspecific and include the
          following: <br />
          ● Headache <br />
          ● Altered mental status <br />
          ● Nausea <br />
          ● Vomiting <br />
          ● Weakness<br />
          ● Gait disturbance <br />
          ● Focal seizures<br />
          ● Visual changes<br />
          ● Speech deficits<br />
          ● Focal sensory abnormalities etc.<br />
          As most of the brain tumors initially present with very nonspecific
          complaints, early diagnosis by a neurosurgeon or neuro-physician helps
          plan further management in the initial stages of the disease.
          Diagnosis of a brain tumor doesn’t always mean a very poor outcome. A
          lot of CNS tumors are benign and can be cured completely and for life
          by complete surgical removal. Although outcome and survival rate
          mostly depends on the age of the patient, type of tumor and the extent
          of the surgical excision, and molecular characteristics of the
          tumor.<br />
        </p>
        <b style="text-align: center">Types of treatments available-</b><br />
        <p>
          ▪ Surgery: This is the most common treatment for malignant brain
          tumors. The surgeon removes as many of the cancerous cells as possible
          without damaging healthy brain tissue.<br />
           ▪ Radiation Therapy: In this type of treatment,
          radiation like X-rays or protons beams are used to kill tumor
          cells.<br />
          ▪ Chemotherapy: Drugs are injected or taken orally and they target to
          kill the tumor cells. Side-effects of chemotherapy are hair loss,
          vomiting, nausea, and tiredness.<br />
          According to a report published in The Indian Express, a large section
          of Indian has no adequate knowledge about brain tumors. There is a
          misconception that every tumor will either kill or result in a coma
          with multiple problems, mental as well as physical. However, according
          to Dr. Ashish Shrivastav, a senior consultant and neurosurgeon, a
          large majority of brain tumors can be treated successfully and most
          patients resume their normal life. According to another study, the
          incidence of tumors in the central nervous system in India ranges from
          around five to ten cases per 1,00,000 population. Although it’s a
          severe disease, a piece of adequate knowledge and timely treatment can
          save many lives.
