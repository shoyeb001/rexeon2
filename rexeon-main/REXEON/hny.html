            It’s time for new beginning, new days and a new year. Beginning with the blank
             page of this year, we will fill whole page with our happiness, memories, dreams,
              enjoyment and also ups and downs at the end of the year. Midnight on New Year’s is
               a unique kind of magic where, just for a moment, the past and the future exist at the same time.
                It’s that time of year when we reflect on what has gone before and what is yet to take flight.
                 Yet, we have seen that last year 2020 has impacted us too badly as it is considered as graver for
                  everyone because of the outbreak of novel coronavirus. But it doesn’t mean that we don’t hope good
                   in near future. Life is full of ups and downs so we have to gather our courage to overcome hurdles in
                    our life instead of avoiding it. Even if we see some positive side of this rampant situation when people
                     were locked up in their own house in the arena of lockdown makes family member closer to one another. We started
                      spending more time with family as per se in today’s life style, everyone has busy schedule which doesn’t give us chance
                       to spend more time with our loved ones. Now it seems like everything is getting normal day by day and going right back on
                        track which give us a positive sign that bad time doesn’t last long enough. Situations are not in your hand but how do you 
                        face these situations is up to you. It’s you who can turn the challenges into opportunities. In this 2021 make a list of your
                         dreams and turn them into reality.<br>
                         We celebrate new year for the passing of all things old and welcoming the new. The New Year is a reason to celebrate, to party all
                          night, and to embrace positivity. People come out in hoards to see and enjoy fireworks at the stroke of midnight as the New Year starts
                           in each time zone across the world.<br>     
           </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>
        On this new year we love to celebrate this as special occasion, everyone is in  festive mood and planning to spend the New Year at a happening destination with our
         family and loved ones. We plan for trip either for new destinations or our old lovable place. Many people love to do camping and bonfire party at the beach with friends
          in the night, enjoy delicious snacks cooked up on a barbecue, dance around the fire and sing a song. We also love to see snowy sights with our loved ones during New Year eve and reviving our memories.<br>
          A new year brings new ideas, new hopes and of course courage to overcome all the new challenges. I hope this is going to be very special year for all of us. With these positive thoughts we wish you all the
           happiest of new years and may bring tremendous happiness in your life.<br><br>
