          <p>Every year, India observes National Energy Conservation on December 14. The day is organized by the Bureau
            of Energy Efficiency (BEE) – which operates under the Ministry of Power, aiming to present India’s stellar
            achievements in cost-efficient energy production and resource conservation. National Energy Conservation Day
            aims to generate mass awareness in India about the importance of saving energy. Citizens are informed about
            the ways to minimize wastage of energy and to conserve resources. The key objective of the day is to reduce
            the use of energy and to encourage people to use it efficiently. –<br></p>


          <p>However, the conservation of energy is directly related to the conservation of or safeguarding our planet
            which is not only ours but also of subsequent generations. This is not a very tough task to follow rather an
            easy habit we all can inculcate in our day-to-day lives. Starting from unplugging appliances when not in
            use, switching off extra lights in a room, taking public transport instead of driving are a few of the many
            examples of energy conservation. <br>
          </p>
        </div>

      </div>
      <p>
        What is energy and why it is important to conserve energy?
      </p>

      <p>In simple language, energy is anything which has the ability to do a work or cause change. It may exist in
        potential, kinetic, thermal, electrical, chemical or other various forms. In today’s world, energy is not only
        the future; it drives everything in the present. </p>

      <div>
        <p><b>As a global society, we generate and use more energy than ever before, and the demand for energy is
            continuously increasing. While we have been able to expand energy production to keep up with demand, there
            are physical, geographical, and economic limits to how much can be produced. One of the ways to deal with
            the constantly expanding need for energy and the issues it brings is to focus on energy conservation. Energy
            conservation means reducing the consumption of energy by using less of it. This could be in the form of
            using fewer energy services or using devices that require less energy or refraining from using those
            services is another way to conserve energy, but this can also be done by using more energy efficient
            products designed to consume less energy. Energy conservation is a big part of sustainability and
            sustainable development.</b></p>




        <p>Increasing use of energy sources can pose a threat to our surroundings like greenhouse gas emissions that
        accompany many forms of energy generation are accumulating in the atmosphere, bringing the potential for
        climate-related consequences.</p>

        <h3 class="text-center"><u>Ways to conserve energy</u></h3>
        <p>There are many methods to save energy. Most of these involve refraining from using energy-consuming devices whenever possible, while some rely on energy efficient products and practices. Here are some simple ways we can conserve energy and become more energy efficient-</p>
        <ul>
          <li>	Provided that energy cannot be created or destroyed, energy conservation is about conserving it rather than eliminating it. One of the most effective methods to conserve energy is to turn things down that require a lot of heat or energy. Heating a home or office takes a lot of energy, and even turning the thermostat down by a degree or two can create energy savings equivalent to taking several cars off the road.</li>
        <li>Some things are better to turn off completely, as they use energy even when not being actively used. Turning off a ceiling fan or air conditioner when leaving a room helps a great deal to conserve energy, as does shutting off the television when nobody is watching it. Appliances such as televisions, computers also draw energy from the power grid when plugged into a wall even when they are shut off. To reduce energy usage, one should make sure these devices are completely unplugged and not connected to a power source when not in use. </li>
        <li>Substituting certain devices for others is one way of practicing energy efficiency to achieve energy conservation. Some items and devices we need to use on a daily basis, but swapping them for more energy efficient versions could result in valuable energy savings. For example, one could change to more energy-efficient appliances i.e., from regular shower head to a low-flow version that reduces the amount of heated water one need. If we’re looking for a new car, we may consider an electric car or more energy efficient vehicle, such as a hybrid or small economy car. Moreover, one can also think about installing solar energy water heaters and heat pumps in the home. From small changes to more substantial substitutes, every new energy-saving habit we adopt can make big difference in the long run for the environment.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Thus, energy conservation is incredibly important for several reasons. Along with reducing our reliance on non-renewable energy resources (like fossil fuels), it also helps save our money on energy costs, including utility bills. Conserving energy also cuts down on expanding development where natural resource extraction (such as oil or even lithium) is impacting natural areas. When we conserve energy and use it more efficiently, we directly reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions entering the Earth’s atmosphere. So this National Energy Conservation Day, let us be a little more responsible and aware towards saving our planet as well preserving it for us along with future generation.</p>
